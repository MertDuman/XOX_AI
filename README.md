 ## XOX_AI
 
 * Different from the never losing AI's found on the internet since it doesn't use the recursive minimax algorithm.
 * I've wanted to try this as a challenge for myself to recreate a never losing AI without the use of this algorithm.
 * The reason being is, with minimax, AI feels too much like an AI.
 * That means it will always play in the same pattern, no matter how many times you make the same move,
 * even though it's not necessary for 'not losing'.
 * The game board is a square, so essentially, symmetrical moves are all correct. For example, when the player goes middle,
 * going either one of the corners is the correct move.
 * However, a minimax AI will always pick the top left corner. I believe this makes the game dull and not entertaining
 * for the player because the player is easily convinced that he can't win. There is no variety.
 * This recreation of the AI makes seemingly different moves each turn, even if the player makes the same move multiple times.
 * It will still not lose, but will not follow the same pattern all the time.
 * As already stated, it's a 'non-losing' AI, meaning it won't plan to win (but still win if given the chance) but to draw.
 * Enjoy.
